The O

aimed O
to O
investigate O
the O
effects O

These O

the O

This O
apparent O

A O

the O

CONCLUSIONS O

This O

demonstrates O
that O
chronic O

primarily O
of O
arteriolopathy O
manifesting O
as O

and O
suggests O
that O
mild-type O
chronic O
FK506 O
nephropathy B-PHE
is O
a O
condition O
which O
may O

RESULTS O
: O
Head-up O

was O
marked O
in O
six O

A O
lesser O

orthostatic B-PHE

Orthostatic B-PHE
hypotension I-PHE
was O
ameliorated O
4 O

selegiline O
and O
totally O
abolished O
7 O
days O
after O
discontinuation O
of O
the O

Stopping O
selegiline O
also O
significantly O
reduced B-PHE

CONCLUSION O
: O
This O

our O

BACKGROUND O
: O
Fibrin O

( O

) O
derived O
from O

are O
frequently O
used O
in O

In O

, O
FS O
typically O

, O
a O
natural O

Recently O
, O
synthetic O
fibrinolysis O

such O
as O
tranexamic O
acid O
( O
tAMCA O
) O
have O
been O
considered O
as O
substitutes O
for O
aprotinin O
. O

However O
, O
tAMCA O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
cause O
epileptic B-PHE
seizures I-PHE
. O

We O
wanted O
to O
study O
whether O
tAMCA O
retains O
its O
convulsive B-PHE
action O
if O
incorporated O
into O
a O
FS O
. O

METHOD O
: O
FS O
containing O
aprotinin O
or O
different O
concentrations O
of O
tAMCA O
( O
0.5-47.5 O
mg/ml O
) O
were O
applied O
to O
the O
pial O
surface O
of O
the O
cortex O
of O
anaesthetized O
rats O
. O

The O
response O
of O
the O
animals O
was O
evaluated O
using O
electroencephalography O
and O
by O
monitoring O
the O
clinical O
behaviour O
during O
and O
after O
recovery O
from O
anaesthesia O
. O

FINDINGS O
: O
FS O
containing O
tAMCA O
caused O
paroxysmal O
brain O
activity O
which O
was O
associated O
with O
distinct O
convulsive B-PHE
behaviours O
. O

The O
degree O
of O
these O
seizures B-PHE
increased O
with O
increasing O
concentration O
of O
tAMCA O
. O

Thus O
, O
FS O
containing O
47.5 O
mg/ml O
tAMCA O
evoked O
generalized B-PHE
seizures I-PHE
in O
all O
tested O
rats O
( O
n=6 O
) O
while O
the O
lowest O
concentration O
of O
tAMCA O
( O
0.5 O
mg/ml O
) O
only O
evoked O

episodes O
of O

potentials O
in O
1 O
of O
6 O
rats O

In O
contrast O
, O
FS O
containing O

did O
not O
evoke O
any O
paroxysmal O

INTERPRETATION O
: O
Tranexamic O
acid O
retains O
its O
convulsive B-PHE

within O
FS O

Thus O

BACKGROUND O
: O
Glioblastoma B-PHE
is O
a O
malignant B-PHE
tumor I-PHE
that O
occurs O
in O
the O
cerebrum O
during O

. O

With O

, O
the O
average O
life O
expectancy O
of O
the O
patients O
is O
limited O
to O
approximately O
1 O
year O
. O

Therefore O
, O
patients O
with O
glioblastoma B-PHE
sometimes O
have O
intracarotid O
injection O
of O
carcinostatics O
added O
to O
the O
treatment O
regimen O
. O

Generally O
, O
carboplatin O

, O
whose O
ocular B-PHE

are O
well O
known O
. O

However O
, O
we O
experienced O

CASE O
: O
A O
58-year-old O
man O
received O
an O
intracarotid O

of O
carboplatin O
for O
recurrent O

his O
left O

He O

CONCLUSION O

that O
this O

very O

that O

However O
, O
one O
drawback O

such O

the O
fact O
that O

CONCLUSIONS O
: O
The O
data O

that O

an O
important O
role O

Because O
such O
a O

occurs O
to O
reduce O
injury B-PHE

as O
the O
infusion O
was O
stopped O
and O
the O

. O

The O

concurrent O
medications O
included O

, O
hydroxyzine O
, O
promethazine O
, O
hydrocortisone O
, O
and O

Despite O
administration O
of O

, O
the O
seizures B-PHE
persisted O
and O
occurred O
only O
during O

DISCUSSION O
: O

, O
both O
of O
which O
the O
patient O
had O
, O
can O
potentially O
cause O

. O

The O
patient O
had O
a O
history O
of O
alcohol B-PHE
abuse I-PHE
; O
alcohol O
intake O
as O
well O
as O

can O
also O
cause O

. O

Didanosine O
also O
has O
a O
potential O
for O
inducing O

However O
, O
these O
other O
potential O
causes O
of O

out O
. O

The O
time O

SUMMARY O
: O
A O
41-year-old O
Chinese O
man O
with O
a O
history O
of O
hyperthyroidism B-PHE

been O
treated O
with O

. O

He O
received O
a O
10-day O

DISCUSSION O
: O
Although O
there O
is O

A O

presented O
with O
persistent O
hiccups B-PHE
after O
beginning O
azithromycin O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O

. O
Hiccups B-PHE
were O
persistent O
and O
exhausting O
. O

Discontinuation O
of O
azithromycin O
and O
therapy O
with O

resolved O

. O

No O

was O
identified O
despite O
extensive O

DISCUSSION O
: O
Pharmacotherapeutic O
agents O
have O
been O
uncommonly O
associated O
with O
hiccups B-PHE
. O

Corticosteroids O
( O

and O
methylprednisolone) O
, O
benzodiazepines O
( O
midazolam O
) O
and O
general O

have O
been O
the O
specific O
agents O
mentioned O
most O
frequently O
in O
the O
literature O
as O
being O
associated O
with O
the O
development O
of O
hiccups B-PHE
. O

Few O
cases O
of O

have O
been O
reported O
related O
to O

mostly O
because O
of O
the O

this O

macrolides O
and O
the O
absence O
of O
any O
alternative O
explanation O
for O
hiccups B-PHE
. O

Our O
hypothesis O
is O
that O
a O
vagal O
mechanism O
mediated O
by O
azithromycin O
could O
be O
the O
pathogenesis O
of O
hiccups B-PHE

CONCLUSIONS O
: O
Diagnosis O
of O
drug-induced O
hiccups B-PHE
is O
difficult O
and O
often O
achieved O
only O
by O

However O
, O
macrolide O

have O
been O
reported O
to O
be O
associated O
with O
hiccups B-PHE

Tacrolimus O
is O
a O
potent O

that O
is O
frequently O
used O
in O

. O

However O
, O
adverse O

cardiac B-PHE

Herein O
we O
describe O
transient O
myocardial B-PHE
hypertrophy I-PHE
induced O
by O
tacrolimus O
after O
heart O
transplantation O
. O

The O
hypertrophy B-PHE
caused O
no O
clinical O
symptoms O
but O
was O
noted O
because O
of O
elevation O
of O
plasma O
brain O
natriuretic O
peptide O
concentration O
and O
confirmed O
at O

Initially O
, O
allograft O

was O
feared O
; O
however O
, O
myocardial O

samples O
revealed O
only O
interstitial O

and O
mild O
myocardial B-PHE
hypertrophy I-PHE
; O
neither O
cellular O
nor O
humoral O
rejection O
was O
detected O
. O

The O
blood O
tacrolimus O
concentration O
was O
higher O
than O
usual O
at O
that O
time O
; O
thus O
, O
tacrolimus O
dosage O
was O
reduced O
. O
Myocardial B-PHE
hypertrophy I-PHE
completely O
resolved O
upon O
reducing O
the O
target O
concentration O
of O
tacrolimus O
and O
did O
not O
recur O
, O
as O
confirmed O
at O

myocardial O

. O

Thus O
, O
we O
conclude O
that O
tacrolimus O
induces O

myocardial B-PHE

. O

In O

BACKGROUND O

Recent O

PICTURE O
: O
Three O

TREATMENT O
: O
Despite O

CONCLUSIONS O
: O
Ethambutol O

BACKGROUND O
: O
In O
recent O
studies O
increased O
amounts O
of O
nitric O
oxide O
( O
NO O
) O
and O
apoptosis O
have O
been O
implicated O
in O
various O
pathological O
conditions O
in O
the O

. O

We O
have O
studied O
the O
role O
of O
NO O
and O
its O
association O
with O
apoptosis O
in O
an O
experimental O

of O

METHODS O
: O
The O
alteration O
in O
the O
NO O
pathway O
was O
assessed O
by O
measuring O
nitrite O
levels O
in O
serum/urine O
and O
by O
evaluating O
the O
changes O
in O
vascular O

of O
the O
isolated O
perfused O
rat O
kidney O
( O

. O

Rats O
were O
stratified O
into O

. O

These O
two O
groups O
were O
then O
divided O
into O
: O
group O
1, O
animals O
receiving O
saline O

and O
group O
2, O
animals O
receiving O
aminoguanidine O
( O
AG O
) O
which O
is O
a O

. O

On O

RESULTS O
: O
Histopathological O
examination O
of O
the O

They O
also O

(P O

in O
the O

. O

In O
the O

were O
significantly O
impaired O
in O
the O

. O

Apoptosis O

However O
, O
in O
the O

numerous O

Treatment O

CONCLUSION O
: O
We O

that O

One O
of O
the O

PURPOSE O
: O
Apnea B-PHE

known O
to O
occur O

systematic O
studies O

Here O
we O

METHODS O
: O
Twelve O
rats O
( O
six O
chronically O
epileptic B-PHE
animals O
and O
six O
controls O
) O
were O
anesthetized O
, O
given O
tracheotomies O
, O
and O
subjected O
to O
hyperventilation B-PHE
or O

conditions O
. O

Breathing O

forced O
air O
to O
flow O
tidally O
through O
a O

This O

was O
measured O

RESULTS O
: O
The O
hyperventilation B-PHE

caused O
a O

in O
pilocarpine-treated O
and O

Although O

a O

in O
both O
groups O
, O
in O
the O
epileptic B-PHE

, O
the O
decrease O

The O

led O
to O
an O

in O
the O

, O
followed O
by O
an O

In O
the O
epileptic B-PHE
group O
, O
the O
increase O
in O

CONCLUSIONS O
: O
The O

PURPOSE O
: O
Despite O
its O
well-known O
cardiotoxicity B-PHE
, O
the O
anthracyclin O
doxorubicin O
( O

agent O
. O

DOX-induced O

The O

showed O
cardioprotection O
against O
DOX-induced O
cardiotoxicity B-PHE
through O
its O
radical O
scavenging O
and O

. O

Because O

the O
relatively O

final O
half-life O
of O

Therefore O
, O
the O

CONCLUSIONS O
: O
These O
are O
the O
first O
data O
, O
to O
our O
knowledge O
, O
to O
show O
that O
treatment O

can O
alleviate O
cognitive B-PHE
deficits I-PHE
due O
to O
Pb O
exposure O
. O

These O
findings O
suggest O
that O
it O
may O
be O
possible O
to O
identify O
a O
succimer O

However O
, O
they O
also O

These O

be O
due O
